Saphyra 2024 Spring Report
===

__Saphyra__ is an proof assistant under development, with simplicity and user-friendliness as goals. As of April 1, 2024, it is able to verify some simple statements about natural numbers and automatically prove (propositional) tautologies with â‰¤ 6 variables (the limit is artificial to avoid long running loops). A Web user interface is also added, so you can prove propositions by clicking on suitable tactics.

This software is in its early stages and incomplete, but I have plans to continue developing it and switch to ZFC / ETCS / Dependent Types as foundation, so that it may formalize most of modern mathematics.
