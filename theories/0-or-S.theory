[comment
    every natural number is either 0 or a successor]

[prove #zero-0 [=-i]
       |- (= O O)]

[prove #zero [or-il #zero-0]
       |- (or (= O O)
              (exists (=> nat m (= O (S m)))))]

(comment - to be proven
[prove #end [peano-2 #zero #succ]
    |-
    (forall (=> nat n
                (or (= n O)
                    (exists (=> nat m (= n (S m)))))))]
)

(comment - developing in this language is very tiring, especially without templates.)
